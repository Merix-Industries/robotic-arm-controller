# Simple Robotic Arm controller

This was the first PCB design we created: a small circuit board featuring two potentiometers and a button for controlling a simple robotic arm of our own construction.
Features
Two potentiometers for precise servo control
Button for gripper operation
ATmega328P microcontroller
Custom PCB designed in KiCad
Technical Details

The board uses an ATmega328P microcontroller programmed via Arduino IDE. The two potentiometers control the arm's rotation and reach, while the button operates the gripper mechanism.
